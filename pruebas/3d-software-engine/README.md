# 3D Software Engine

A 3D software engine is a software framework or toolset designed to facilitate the creation and rendering of three-dimensional graphics in real-time applications. These engines are essential for developing interactive 3D environments, including video games, simulations, and virtual reality experiences. They provide features like graphics rendering, physics simulation, audio support, scene management, and scripting. While GPUs and APIs like DirectX or WebGL/OpenGL handle computation efficiently, building a software engine from scratch can be an educational endeavor, deepening your understanding of 3D computer graphics.
