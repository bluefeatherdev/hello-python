Important: 
- In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content!
- MongoDB waits until you have created a collection (table), 
- with at least one document (record) 
- before it actually creates the database (and collection).

Remember: 
- In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content, 
- so if this is your first time creating a database, you should complete the next two chapters 
- (create collection and create document) before you check if the database exists!

How do I connect to my MongoDB M0 (cluster):
- Get the connection string
- Use "MongoDB for VS Code." 
- Establish the connection to the Cluster using the connection string
- Import MongoDB credentials with a secret module

Insert:
- A document in MongoDB is the same as a record in SQL databases.
- If you do not specify an _id field, then MongoDB will add one for you and assign a unique id for each document.
- The insert_many() method returns a InsertManyResult object, which has a property, inserted_ids, that holds the ids of the inserted documents.
- Remember that the values (_id) has to be unique. Two documents cannot have the same _id.

Find:
- In MongoDB we use the find() and find_one() methods to find data in a collection.
- Just like the SELECT statement is used to find data in a table in a MySQL database.
