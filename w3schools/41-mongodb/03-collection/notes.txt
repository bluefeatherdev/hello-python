Important: 
- In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content!
- MongoDB waits until you have created a collection (table), 
- with at least one document (record) 
- before it actually creates the database (and collection).

Remember: 
- In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content, 
- so if this is your first time creating a database, you should complete the next two chapters 
- (create collection and create document) before you check if the database exists!

How do I connect to my MongoDB M0 (cluster):
- Get the connection string
- Use "MongoDB for VS Code." 
- Establish the connection to the Cluster using the connection string
- Import MongoDB credentials with a secret module
