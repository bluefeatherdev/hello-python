Important!:
- Notice the statement: mydb.commit(). 
- It is required to make the changes, 
- otherwise no changes are made to the table.

Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE syntax:
- The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be deleted. 
- If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be deleted!
