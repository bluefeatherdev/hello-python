Important!:
- Notice the statement: mydb.commit(). 
- It is required to make the changes, 
- otherwise no changes are made to the table.

Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE syntax: 
- The WHERE clause specifies which record or records that should be updated. 
- If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be updated!

Prevent SQL Injection:
- It is considered a good practice to escape the values of any query, also in update statements.
- This is to prevent SQL injections, which is a common web hacking technique to destroy or misuse your database.
- The mysql.connector module uses the placeholder %s to escape values in the update statement
